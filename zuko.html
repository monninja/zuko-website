            <h2> Zuko Quote </h2>
            <q> I've struggled for so long to do what's right; to even 
                know what's right. [...] But asking you to end me if I 
                went bad; that was like asking you to figure out right 
                and wrong for me. [...] I understand now. The struggle 
                isn't something a Fire Lord can escape.</q>
